# WMS Screenshot Image

**Please add your WMS screenshot here:**

1. Save the screenshot as `wms-background.png` or `wms-background.jpg`
2. Place it in this `public` folder
3. The app will automatically use it as the background

The image should show the ILPNS WMS interface.

**Alternative:** You can also place it in `frontend/src/assets/` and import it in the component.
